Potential 4 misses person? None
Treating engaging in increase in significant behaviors? Allyson, Daniel
    Allyson: figuring out lack of engagement for one of her group patients
    Daniel: past few weeks uptick in behavior. Two weeks ago he was flipping chairs. One week ago he pushed his social worker down. This week made an allegation of a sexual nature about another peer. Talked with Daniel about "anything and everything under the sun".

Notes from prior meeting approved (M/S/P) Allyson, Anna, Unanimous


Would like to do a group on Lodge H 
    Daniel: have some guys on H who would benefit from a group. Would like to start after week 1 for new cohort
    Anna and Daniel talk through in supervision

Will need to look at the calendar.
